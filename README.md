# Automatic Speech Recognition Study
## Part of the ASR course at The University of Edinburgh
In this paper, we present the results of an ASR study conducted on a small collection of recordings from ASR students on this year’s (2023) course. The recordings consist of short utterances with words randomly selected from the famous tongue twister "Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers. Where’s the peck of pickled peppers Peter Piper picked?"
